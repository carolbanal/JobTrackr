We're a fast-moving startup on a mission to revolutionize the call centre industry using the power of AI and Large Language Models. We’re building intelligent systems to enhance customer experience, supercharge agent performance, and drive operational excellence.

Through advanced conversational AI, we build systems that understand, adapt, and evolve with every conversation. Our platform powers decision-support tools and intelligent virtual agents helping call centers deliver faster, smarter, and more human customer service—where every interaction matters.

As an ML Engineer, you’ll design, train, and deploy models that not only empower better decisions and agent experiences—but also power the core intelligence behind real-time conversations. If you're a self-starter with a passion for deploying ML at scale and know how to get your hands dirty with LLMs, we want you on our founding team.

What You’ll Do
• Design, build, and deploy ML pipelines and LLM-powered applications from scratch.
• Fine-tune, prompt, and integrate state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, LLaMA, Mistral).
• Apply advanced techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), tool use, and embedding search.
• Collaborate with product and engineering to build AI-driven features for real-world call centre use cases (e.g., agent coaching, auto summarization, sentiment analysis).
• Own experiments end-to-end — from hypothesis to deployment — with minimal supervision.
• Optimize model inference (latency, memory) for production-scale workloads.
• Set up scalable infrastructure for model training, evaluation, and continuous improvement.
• Help shape our ML/AI roadmap and contribute to technical strategy.

What We’re Looking For
• 3+ years of experience as an ML Engineer
• Deep expertise in NLP and LLMs (e.g., transformers, LoRA, vector search, prompt engineering).
• Strong Python skills and hands-on experience with frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, OpenAI, PyTorch.
• Experience deploying ML models in production (e.g., APIs, containers, cloud-based services).
• Comfort working in early-stage/startup environments — fast pace, lots of ambiguity, high impact.
• Ability to work autonomously and make product-informed decisions with minimal oversight.

Bonus Points For
• Experience in or knowledge of the call centre / contact centre space.
• Familiarity with voice-to-text models, real-time analytics, or conversation intelligence.
• MLOps experience (e.g., model versioning, monitoring, CI/CD).
• Prior experience with vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate).

Why Join Us?
• Be part of a mission-driven startup from the ground up.
• Shape the future of AI in a high-impact, real-world industry.
• Work remotely with flexibility and autonomy.
